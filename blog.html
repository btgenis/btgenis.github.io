                    <h1 class="featured">More about watercolor</h1>
                    <p>I was scrolling down the watercolor rabbit hole the other day (it seems like this blog is turning more and more into a watercolor diary!) when I came across something that lit a lightbulb in my head (an unfortunate choice of metaphor in Turkey). These days, I’ve been spending my free time taking small steps to get back into watercolor painting. Out of curiosity, I checked one of the YouTube channels I used to follow, a watercolor artist, and noticed he’d pinned a video from two years ago in his featured section. In that video, he argued that there’s a difference between simply painting a landscape and turning it into art. That not everyone can become a landscape painter in the sense of being able to translate onto paper the emotion or the particular feeling the scene evokes in them.</p>
                    <p>I couldn’t agree more. That was the moment I realized why I hadn’t been painting for so long. Back in the day, I was in that stage of learning how to apply the technique to paper, and the joy of progress alone kept me going. But after a long stretch of learning, it all started to feel repetitive and, worse, empty. The paintings didn’t say anything, or maybe I didn’t have anything to say. They were just “pretty landscapes.” And if I didn’t have anything to say, I couldn’t bring myself to keep painting.</p>
                    <p>I can’t stand a piece that says nothing. I don’t mean that a painting should express something I can clearly understand. Even when an artist pours their most incommunicable, most unrelatable emotions or thoughts onto a canvas, we can still appreciate its artistic value. In that sense, I think I’m like most people. (Which is probably why AI art feels utterly meaningless to so many.)</p>
                    <p>The watercolor scene online is full of landscapes, still lifes, and portraits that use every color in the palette like the pictures on a watercolor set for children (because that’s what watercolor is about, apparently), all just empty decorations. Most of the paintings I “produced” were no exception. And there’s only so much schoolwork one can take before wanting to create something that actually means something.</p>
                    <p>That was all, for the diagnosis. Now for the treatment.</p>

                    <p>I came home this afternoon a little tired and saw it on the wall: a painting I made three years ago. A portrait in watercolor. (Not the one in the picture!) That was around the time I was really into John Singer Sargent and his work with watercolor. Like many people who try the medium, I wanted to be able to paint the way he did. Of course, it was hopeless.</p>
                    <p>I don’t really know why I’ve stuck with watercolor instead of oil or something else. It’s always been difficult: the water runs in every direction, it evaporates, and the painting dries within minutes, so there’s only a short window to work before it sets. Oil, on the other hand, can stay wet for weeks and lets you keep changing things long after you’ve started. But the trade-offs come with their own unique advantages. Also, watercolor was easier to get and carry around.</p>
                    <p>I looked at that painting, the like of which I probably couldn’t make again without a few months of practice, and wondered why I haven’t painted a single piece since. I have to admit, I must have lost half of whatever skill I had. I probably didn’t have much to begin with. Still, I was surprised that I had once been able to make a painting like that at all.</p>
                    <p>Now and then I come across Sargent again, and it stirs in me the urge to paint. But once you step away from something for a long time, going back to it is never easy. Especially when that something is watercolor, which never forgives even the smallest break.</p>

                    <h1 class="featured">The Tartar Steppe</h1>
                    <p>I finished <i>The Tartar Steppe</i> by Dino Buzzati today. It was the most disturbing book I’ve read in quite some time—not because it depicted gruesome scenes or anything, but because it resonated with me at this particular time in my life. I don’t quite know how to put it. It’s a book about waiting and waiting and waiting, while life passes by.</p>
                    <img loading="lazy" src="blogSrc/img/the_tartar_steppe.jpg" class="tiny">
                    <p>The protagonist is appointed to a run-down fringe castle as an army officer, full of high hopes. He dreams of a prestigious career in the army, a pleasant life in the city, and marrying a beautiful woman to start a family. This appointment seems to him only a small inconvenience on the way to his better life. After all, he is still young and has many years ahead of him.</p>
                    <p>But, as you may guess, the castle has its own plans. Everyone there seems to be waiting for the defining moment of their lives: the invasion that might come from the desert in the north. He meets other officers—some new like him, some old, some who have been waiting ten, fifteen years, or even a lifetime. At first, it all seems absurd to him, and he decides he will leave as soon as possible. But as the months pass, he too falls under the spell of the castle.</p>
                    <p>So far removed from the city, the fortress imposes its own rhythm of life. He begins to think in its terms. Waiting for the never-coming invasion becomes an obsession, and then simply his life. Each time an opportunity arises to leave, he tells himself he is still young and has years ahead. Until, at last, he is an old man, barely able to move, still waiting.</p>
                    <p>At first, it was the long wait that disturbed me. And it should be disturbing to any young person who endures unpleasant times while hoping for something better in the future. But the most troubling part, for me, was the paralysis of decision the protagonist must have felt each time an opportunity to leave arose—the indecision between continuing to believe in the long wait and starting something new. At one point in the book, the protagonist actually leaves the castle, only to find that the life he once had in the city has become unfamiliar to him.</p>
                    <p>It is not so simple, though. At first glance, that long wait seems like an imprudent decision on the protagonist’s part. But the coin has two sides: the wait gives his life a meaning, however wearisome. His life may have passed him by with all its possibilities—most of them likely better than the one he actually lived—but perhaps the important thing is not whether those possibilities were realized, but that his life passed at all.</p>
                    <p>The novel as a whole was fine. <i>But was it really good that I read it? Or should I have spent that time on something else? Each time I picked it back up, did the choice to continue lead to a better outcome than the paths I left behind?</i></p>
                    <p>One thing’s for sure: I won’t be reading anything existential again for at least two years.</p>

                    <p>This is one of the most spectacular things I’ve seen in a while: a golden crown of maple leaves and acorns dating back to the 3rd century BC, discovered in Pergamon, modern-day Bergama, İzmir. Saw it at the İstanbul Archaeological Museums. It was incredibly delicate the acorns at the tips of the branches seemed to wiggle with every passerby.</p>

                    <p>Sketched this from a rooftop in Eminönü, overlooking the Bosphorus. We had been sitting under the awnings in the picture just the other night. I hadn’t expected much from a café in that part of the city, but it turned out to be wonderful, especially the nighttime view: the Bosphorus on one side, Süleymaniye on the other. We spent a couple of hours reading our books before heading out for a long ferry ride.</p>

                    <p>I’m not sure what this blog will turn into. I’ve gotten extremely good at publishing <i>websites</i> for blogs, but when it comes to actually filling them with posts... well, that’s another story. Maybe it’s an obsession, this undying love for self-published sites. Over the years, I must have launched a dozen of them, purely for the joy of designing each one from scratch.</p>
                    <p>I still remember the first time I got my hands on a book about web design for kids. From that moment, I was fascinated by the idea of creating and publishing websites. It feels almost like an ancient practice now, yet I don’t think there’s any other way of publishing text-based content that offers quite the same level of creative control.</p>
                    <p>I don’t want this “blog” to be anything more than a single web page that displays snippets of content all at once. Not a site with separate post pages, categories, or tags... and definitely not one where each entry has its own share link. It’s simply a single page with entry after entry, but with a slightly smarter way of highlighting one at a time.</p>
                    <p>Once again, design takes center stage. Function exists only to reveal the potential of form. Something almost heretical in the world of text-based content.</p>
